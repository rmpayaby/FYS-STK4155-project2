# FYS-STK4155-project2
This repository contains the codes used in project 2

Sample runs are to be found in the folder plots_for_sample_runs 

Data sets for the regression and classification problem are stored in the data_sets-folder. 

All codes used are to be found in the src-folder.

A simple SGD-algorithm prior to applying it to neural networks can be found on sgd_experiment.py.
To show the distribution of features in a data set, use distrib_data.py

The following codes are relevant for each setting:

Neural network regression: neural_net_regression.py, Regression.py, Regression_run.py

Neural network classification: Classify.py, Classify_run.py

Logistic regression: LogReg.py, logreg_execution.py

Sample codes of neural networks using Keras and Scikit can be found in the folder testing_code_with_scikit_keras.
